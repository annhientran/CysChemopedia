# Cysteine Proteomics Encyclopedia

Project status: WIP

## Description
Here, we develop the Cysteine Chemoproteomics Encyclopedia, a comprehensive and quantitative mapping of the cysteine redox proteome using different small molecule compounds in both mouse and human tissues. Using our complex mass spectrometry method, we seek to establish a collective database illustrating how individual small molecule alters the cysteine redox networks in a tissue-specific and organism-specific manner. The mechanistic basis of small molecules on cysteine oxidation can elucidate a better understanding of the general physiology in each cell type and facilitate drug discovery.
